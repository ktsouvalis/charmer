# The result is one executable file carrying charmer plus its pure-Python
# dependencies (paramiko, PyYAML, Jinja2, rich, textual and their transitive

#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* BUNDLED
# -----------------------------------
# zipimport cannot load compiled extension modules (.so) out of a zip, so
# paramiko's compiled dependencies must come from the system:
#
#     sudo apt install python3-cryptography python3-bcrypt python3-nacl
#
# This is a feature, not a workaround. cryptography stays on the
# distribution's security-update track instead of being frozen inside a
# release artifact that nobody re-cuts for six months. Bundling it would also
# make this file architecture-specific; as built, it runs on any CPython
# >= 3.10.

paramiko is LGPL-2.1: the version bundled here is unmodified, readable Python source, sitting in this same archive next to the license that covers it.

Pangolin CE, Newt and Gerbil (fosrl/pangolin, fosrl/newt, fosrl/gerbil) are separate, dual-licensed AGPL-3.0/Fossorial Commercial projects that charmer orchestrates over SSH and Docker at deploy time. None of their source is bundled here; see README 'License' for details."
